# Budget Books - In Development

A React web-app for consolidating transaction data and bank account balances. Budget Books aims to be a central place to analyze personal finance in a simple, straightforward way while providing users that want more customization in their analysis tools to dig deeper. It empowers users to take control of their financial data with any degree of granularity that they want.

## Skills Showcase

Aside from creating a useful application for personal use, this repository is also meant to showcase my abilities as a developer as I learn more about the TypeScript/React ecosystems. In particular, I hope that it showcases my dedication to the following:

- Git
  - Good commit messages
  - Good integration with GitHub using issues, PRs, etc.
- Documentation
  - Readable, maintainable code with comments as necessary
  - Description of the app's functionality/future plans
  - Writing good ticket and issue descriptions for the scope of work
- Testing
  - Writing good unit tests with good coverage
  - Integrating unit tests into the development workflow
- Full-Stack Development
  - Being able to develop front and back end systems concurrently, accounting for changes in either (also see the [Python backend repo](https://github.com/LukasErekson/budget-books-backend))
- CI/CD
  - Use of GitHub Actions to simulate a full CI/CD environment (_Coming Soon..._)

# Planned Features

The app should allow users to view their personal Balance Sheet and expense reports for specific snapshots in time, defaulting to the current day. There should also be basic visualization tools that allow the user to compare spending and balances across time periods.
