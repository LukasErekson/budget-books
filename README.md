# Budget Books

A web-app for consolidating transaction data and bank account balances. Budget Books aims to be a central place to analyze personal finance in a simple, straightforward way while providing users that want more customization in their analysis tools to dig deeper. It empowers users to take control of their financial data with any degree of granularity that they want.

The app should allow users to view their personal Balance Sheet and expense reports for specific snapshots in time, defaulting to the current day. There should also be basic visualization tools that allow the user to compare spending and balances across time periods.
